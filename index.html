				Insights about the original visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><u>Seasonal Trends & Surges</u>: The visualization depicts new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. over three years (2020, 2021, and 2022). The spiral format suggests recurring surges, especially in winter</strong>.</li>

				<li><u>Omicron Peak (Jan 2022)</u>: The highest spike is at the beginning of 2022, <strong>unlike US had seen</strong> so far till publication of the graph. This peak is significantly larger than those in previous years.</li>

				<li><u>Yearly Comparison</u>: The visualization highlights how each yearâ€™s <strong>cases built upon </strong> the previous year. 2021 saw a higher baseline than 2020, and 2022 started with an unprecedented spike.</li>

				<li><u>7-day Average</u>: The visualization <strong>smooths daily fluctuations </strong> by using a 7-day rolling average, making trends easier to see.</li>

				<li><u>Declines and Plateaus</u>: After peaks in each year, case numbers decrease but <strong>never return to zero</strong>, indicating persistent infections even in off-peak seasons.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong><u>Design Critique</u></strong>: The original visualization effectively conveys the progression of COVID-19 cases over time. While the design is visually striking and emphasizes the cyclical nature of outbreaks, it is cognitively straining due to its unconventional structure. Below are key insights and opportunities for refinement:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>CRITIQUE 1: The use of a radial format (spiral  design) enhances narrative appeal by reinforcing the idea of recurring waves of infections. This design can help viewers intuitively grasp the cyclical nature of COVID-19 surges and it successfully condenses a large dataset into a single compelling graphic, making it effective for static media like the opinion article. The non-traditional format makes the visualization eye-catching, which would draw in viewers who might otherwise overlook standard time-series graphs.</li>
				<li>CRITIQUE 2:  The radial format distorts time perception and makes it harder to directly compare case counts across different years. A more structured design using small multiples or overlaid line charts could improve year-to-year comparisons. Maybe concentric rings instead of spiral will reduce the distortion effect.</li>
				<li>CRITIQUE 3: Due to the curvature of the spiral, certain peaks may appear more pronounced or misleadingly compressed. Also, readers must mentally "unroll" the visualization to follow trends, which increases interpretation effort. This may be particularly challenging for audiences unfamiliar with unconventional time-based encodings. So, a more linear or gridded layout might better preserve the integrity of temporal trends.</li>
				<li>CRITIQUE 4: There is a tradeoff between aesthetic impact and interpretability in the original visualization. Being a public health article, the intended audience is broad. While the spiral format is engaging, modifications that prioritize comparability, readability, and accessibility would make it more effective across different audiences and contexts. FMy sketches will try to balance narrative appeal with practical clarity, ensuring that the visualization serves both exploratory and explanatory functions effectively.</li>
